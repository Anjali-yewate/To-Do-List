# To-Do-List
The To-Do List is a simple web application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that allows users to manage daily tasks efficiently. Users can add, delete, and mark tasks as completed. The application demonstrates the use of:

HTML for structuring the app layout

CSS for styling the interface

JavaScript for dynamic task management (DOM manipulation and event handling)

This project showcases fundamental web development skills and is a great beginner-friendly project to understand client-side interactivity.
